# Future Considerations

This document outlines features, improvements, and best practices that were not implemented in this version due to the four-hour time limit, but would be prioritized in a production-ready version of this project.

---

## 1. Security & Authentication

- Implement JWT authentication for secure asset access
- Add role-based permissions (e.g., view-only, contributor, admin)
- Use HTTPS headers and CSP for content security

## 2. Rate Limiting & Throttling

- Apply rate limits to API routes (if any are used)
- Prevent abuse or excessive asset loading using tools like `express-rate-limit` or CDN edge logic
- Implement retry logic and backoff for client-side fetches

## 3. Performance at Scale

- Replace static JSON with database (SQLite, Postgres) or serverless backend
- Paginate or batch asset fetches dynamically
- Use indexed fields or API filtering to reduce payload size

## 4. Accessibility Improvements

- Add full keyboard support for drag-and-drop
- Include WAI-ARIA roles for all interactive components
- Ensure all color contrast and tab orders meet WCAG 2.1 standards

## 5. UI/UX Enhancements

- Implement asset preview modal on click
- Add filtering or search by board/tag
- Enable drag-and-drop asset reordering (initially stubbed out)

## 6. Advanced Testing

- Expand to full test suite (unit + integration + E2E)
- Use Cypress or Playwright for interactive tests
- Add CI coverage reporting and PR test gating

## 7. DevOps & Monitoring

- Add error tracking via Sentry or LogRocket
- Include performance analytics (e.g., Web Vitals)
- Set up GitHub Actions workflow for build + test + lint

## 8. Internationalization

- Prepare assets and UI strings for i18n compatibility
- Load locale-specific text or formats dynamically

These ideas reflect longer-term maintainability and user needs, and would be explored after MVP validation or user feedback.
